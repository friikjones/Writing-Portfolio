This is the git pages repository to show my writing works.

There are both portuguese and english writing, mostly around RPG settings and adventures, and the DnD world.

## RPG - English
This pieces represent a role-playing game campaing idea in the making.

[P] is what the player would see at first, it is a job posting for adventurers.

[GM] is what the Game Master would see, with the actual dungeon ideas and inhabitants.

## RPG - Portugues
This pieces are separated in two groups, Medieval and Ancient Egypt. They represent ideas and session notes of two different campaings that happened over skype, in Brazil, in the course of almost a year.

Medieval is a homebrew world, based on regular Dungeons and Dragons, with settings and dungeons custom made for the players.

Ancient Egypt is a re-skin of regular DnD, but based of Ancient Egypt, with it's own unique lore, gods, political and social classes and regions.

### Debate
This piece was a submission for a "200 words" themed contest for a role-playing game.

Bonus points were awarded for no setup and the least amount of objects used.
